# `Part I Introduction`

# 1. What is Mathematics About?
> “What is mathematics?” The approach of this book is not to try.  
> Nevertheless, to make sense of all this information it is useful to be able to classify it somehow.
## 1.1 Algebra, Geometry, and Analysis
> Although any classification of the subject matter of mathematics must immediately be hedged around with qualifications, there is a crude division that undoubtedly works well as a first approximation, namely the division of mathematics into algebra, geometry, and analysis.

## 1.2 The Main Branches of Mathematcis
+ `Algebra`: Algebraic structures
+ `Number Theory`: properties of the set of positive integers
+ `Geometry`: manifold
+ `Algebraic Geomety`: singularities
+ `Analysis`: partial differential equations, dynamics
+ `Logic`: Set Theory, Category Theory, Model Theory
+ `Combinatorics`: 
+ `Theoretical Computer Science`: 
+ `Probability`: 
+ `Mathematical Physics`: 


# 2. The Language and Grammar of Mathematics
## 2.1 Introduction
> The main reason for using mathematical grammar is that the statements of mathematics are supposed to be completely precise, and it is not possible to achieve complete precision unless the language one uses is free of many of the vaguenesses and ambiguities of ordinary speech.
## 2.2 Four Basic Concepts
+ `Sets`: $ i\in S, \empty $
+ `Functions`: mathematical transformation
    + `domain`, `range`, `image`
    + `injection`, `surjection`, `bijection`
+ `Relations`
    + `equivalence relations`: reflexive, symmetric, transitive
+ `Binary Operations`
    + `commutative`
    + `associative`
    + `identity`
    + `inverse`
## 2.3 Some Elementary Logic
+ `Logical Connectives`: $ \land, \lor, \implies  $
+ `Quantifiers`: $ \forall, \exists$
+ `Negation`: $\lnot $
+ `Free and Bound Variables`: $$
