# Part I Introduction

## 1. What is Mathematics About?
> “What is mathematics?” The approach of this book is not to try.  
> Nevertheless, to make sense of all this information it is useful to be able to classify it somehow.
### 1.1 Algebra, Geometry, and Analysis
#### 1.1.1 Algebra versus Geometry
> Thus, while one can draw a useful distinction between algebra and geometry, one should not imagine that the boundary between the two is sharply defined.
#### 1.1.2 Algebra versus Analysis
### 1.2 The Main Branches of Mathematcis
